# Chapter 3 — Building Workflows with LangGraph

**Focus:** state graphs, nodes/edges, conditional routing, memory patterns.
- Chapter intro and scope around **Side 61–62**.

**File:**
- `src/chapter3/langgraph_workflow.py` — small graph: safety check → route → response or error.

**Intent:** Show `StateGraph`, `START/END`, and a `Literal` router. Sets up thinking for agents later.
