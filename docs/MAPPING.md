# Index → PDF page mapping

**Rule:** `pdf_side ≈ index_page − 3` (±1 page in a few entries).

Examples:
- LCEL (Index 42–44) → PDF Side ~39–44.
- Complex LCEL example (Index 45–47) → PDF Side ~42–45.
- LangGraph chapter header → PDF Side 61.
- RAG chapter begins around Side 92; vector store concepts around Side 110+.

Tip: If a topic is off by more than 3 pages, search by keyword in the PDF viewer.
