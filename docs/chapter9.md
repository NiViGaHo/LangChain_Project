# Chapter 9 â€” Observability and Production Deployment (API example)

**Focus:** production surfaces; here we expose a minimal FastAPI endpoint with async `ainvoke`.
- Chapter 9 thematically covers deployment/observability; we keep a simple chat endpoint consistent with modern async patterns.

**File:**
- `src/chapter9/server_fastapi.py`.

**Intent:** Show correct async integration with a chat model.
